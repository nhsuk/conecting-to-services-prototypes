<h2 id="getting-diagnosed">Getting diagnosed</h2>
<p>Type 2 diabetes is often diagnosed following blood or urine tests for
something else.</p>
<p>However, if you have any <a href="check-if-you-have-it">symptoms of diabetes</a> you
should see your GP straight away.</p>
<div class="muted"><a href="see-a-gp">Book an appointment with your GP online</a>.</div>

<p>To find out if you have type 2 diabetes, you usually have to go through the
following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Speak to your GP about your symptoms.</li>
<li>Your GP will check your urine and arrange a blood test to check your blood
sugar levels. It usually takes about 1 to 2 days for the results to come back.</li>
<li>If you have diabetes, your GP will ask you to come in again to explain the
test results and what will happen next.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="if-youre-diagnosed-with-diabetes">If you’re diagnosed with diabetes</h3>
<p>What your GP will discuss with you during your appointment depends on the
diagnosis and the treatment they recommend.</p>
<p>Generally, they’ll talk to you about:</p>
<ul>
<li>what diabetes is</li>
<li>what high blood sugar means for your health</li>
<li>what medication you’ll have to take</li>
<li>your diet and exercise</li>
<li>your lifestyle, for example alcohol and smoking</li>
</ul>
<section class="callout callout--warning">
  <p>Your GP will do their best to discuss the diagnosis with you but this first
appointment might only be 10 to 15 minutes.</p>

</section>
<h3 id="if-you-have-questions-about-your-diagnosis">If you have questions about your diagnosis</h3>
<p>It’s usually difficult to take in everything the GP tells you during the
appointment.</p>
<p>Talk to family and friends about what the GP told you and write down all the
questions you have.</p>
<p>Then make another GP appointment and take your list of questions with you.</p>
<p>There’s also a lot of <a href="finding-help-and-support">information on diabetes</a>
available.</p>
<h3 id="what-happens-after-the-diagnosis">What happens after the diagnosis</h3>
<p>Usually the following things happen after your diagnosis:</p>
<ol>
<li>Your GP will prescribe <a href="understanding-medication">medication</a>. It might take
time for you to get used to the medication and to find the right amounts for you.</li>
<li>You might need to make changes to your <a href="food-and-keeping-active">diet and be more active.</a></li>
<li>You’ll have to go for <a href="going-for-regular-check-ups">regular type 2 diabetes check ups.</a></li>
<li>You’ll have to look out for certain signs to avoid
<a href="health-problems">other health problems.</a></li>
<li>Ask your GP about a <a href="http://www.desmond-project.org.uk/newlydiagnosedandfoundationmodules-278.html">free education course for type 2 diabetes</a></li>
</ol>
